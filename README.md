# Sidenote

Proxy related directory is only useful to a handful of people. I just didnt want to misplace it. Scrape sources are good links to put into a proxy scraper/checker. API Links are updated regularly. 

### Most popular proxy ports to check when scanning ip range:

8080,4145,999,1080,5678,3128,4153,7302,53281,9443,8085,6666,6969,3629,55443,1085,8888,443,5566,8081,41890,8118,9090,7300,3127,8181,10801,23500,8000,1981,41610,1981,9000,9999,9091,10001,8585,8090
